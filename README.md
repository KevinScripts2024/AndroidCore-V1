# AndroidCore-V1

Nothing much just a arm64 open source Android Executor for people who has small knowledge on modding for Roblox Android like myself. This will be badly coded since i'm not perfectly good at modding Roblox. So i wouldn't recommend using this as your base or what. This uses Visual Studio 2019

**This only has few basic custom functions which isn't good if you want to make Android Executor..**

Addresses is outdated and can be located on ``roblox/lib/update.hpp`` which can be used to update this executor.

**Some of this codes are from the guy named nop**
