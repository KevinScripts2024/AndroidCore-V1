# AndroidCore-V1

Nothing much just a 32bit open source Android Executor for people who has small knowledge on modding for Roblox Android like myself. This will be badly coded since i'm not perfectly good at modding Roblox. So i wouldn't recommend using this as your base or what. 

**This only has few basic custom functions which isn't good if you want to make Android Executor..**

Addresses can be located on ``roblox/lib/update.hpp`` which can be used to update this executor.
